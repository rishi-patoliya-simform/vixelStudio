     ```
     - Run Android app in production environment 

     ```bash
     yarn run android:prod
     ```
    
- Note: After each change to the ```app.config.js``` file, you need to run the prebuild command for the corresponding environment.

    ```bash
     yarn prebuild:dev
    ```
    ```bash

    ```
    - Note: Generates only an APK file, located at `~/PROJECT_DIR/android/app/build/`.
  - For iOS
    - i.e. Preview release build
    ```bash
     yarn build:ios:preview YOUR-TEAM-ID
    ```
    - To export the IPA, pass `true` as an argument in the build command.
    ```bash
     yarn build:ios:preview YOUR-TEAM-ID true
    ```
    - Note: The IPA and archive will be located at `~/PROJECT_DIR/ios/ios/build`.

- Note: This yarn scripts will lint your code first. If there are no lint errors, then it will run the ios or android app. Otherwise it will show the lint errors in the terminal.
